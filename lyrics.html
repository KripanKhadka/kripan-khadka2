        I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy

I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left

The shell of a man that could never be his best

If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah


All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me

All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me

All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down


Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down


I got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy

I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left (nothing left)
The shell of a man who could never be his best (be his best)
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun (see the sun)


You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me...
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down, yeah

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
